# Sonora ‚Äì An Autonomous Analyst for AML

This repository contains the reproducible codebase for **Sonora**, an autonomous analyst based on **Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)**, designed to support **Anti-Money Laundering (AML)** activities in financial institutions.  

Sonora was developed as part of a Master‚Äôs dissertation at the Instituto Tecnol√≥gico de Aeron√°utica (ITA), Brazil, focusing on combining **high recall performance** with **interpretability** to meet the regulatory and operational demands of AML monitoring.

## üîç Overview

AML monitoring is a critical function for financial institutions but faces two main challenges:
- **Data imbalance**: suspicious transactions are rare compared to legitimate ones.  
- **Complexity of illicit strategies**: criminal actors constantly adapt to conceal the origin of resources.  

Sonora addresses these issues by combining:
- Gradient Boosting‚Äìbased predictive modeling (with hyperparameter optimization).  
- Threshold-oriented evaluation, prioritizing **recall** over accuracy to reduce regulatory risks.  
- SHAP-based explanations to enhance transparency and support human analysts.

- Data preparation and cleaning routines.  
- Model training and evaluation (Gradient Boosting, XGBoost as baseline).  
- Threshold analysis and performance metrics (recall, precision, F1, ROC, PR curves).  
- SHAP-based global and local explanations for interpretability.
